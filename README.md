A variety of helper scripts for the game Lacuna Expanse. Some of these scripts are original, but most are adaptations of lemming552's scripts (https://github.com/lemming552/Lacuna). One quick note is that most of the ones I have modified use an 'empire' option. This option is to make it easier to run the scripts from cron for multiple Empires. Please play by the rules! This is not intended for cheaters running multiple empires, but to facilitate assisting members of an Alliance (UNSC in my case).

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
